<!-- Initialize Counters:

length = 0
wordCount = 0
vowelCount = 0
Set of Vowels:

Define a string containing all vowels: vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
Initialize Word Tracking:

inWord = false (This will track if we are currently in a word)
Iterate Through Each Character:

For each character char in the sentence:
Increment length by 1.

If char is in vowels, increment vowelCount by 1.

If char is a space (' '):

If inWord is true:

Increment wordCount by 1.

Set inWord to false.

Else:
Set inWord to true.

Adjust for Final Word:

After the loop, if inWord is true, increment wordCount by 1 (to count the last word).

Adjust Length for Final Period:

Decrement length by 1 to exclude the final period.
Output the Results:

Print length, wordCount, and vowelCount. -->
